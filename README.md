# My Portfolio Website 🌐

This repository contains the code for my personal website, a digital canvas that captures and showcases who I am and what I have accomplished!

You can learn more about me here, find some of my projects, and a copy of my resume!  

Feel free to explore, and if you find any digital footprints, that's just my way of saying, "Thanks for stopping by and leaving a mark!" 🦶💫
